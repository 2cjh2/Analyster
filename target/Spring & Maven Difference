The performance seems fine either way for me. On loading is the same but that might be impacted by internet speed for loading the tables.

Difference in jar sizes:
with = 6.6MB

The old jar was 157 kb - but this jar does not contain the mysql jar - You can tell because you can't log in.

The new jar is 973.8 kb - this one actually contains the mysql jar though

The mysql jar is 834.1 kb

973.8 kb - 834.1 kb = 139.7 kb
